####SailorMoonGo####
###Game Concept###
Players will be able to experience their own Sailor Moon story by integrating the real world and virtual world together using map apis and pokemon go knowledge. Similar to PokemonGo in some ways, and definitely not in others, SailorMoonGo seeks to encourage players to go outside and be their own sailor senshi! The goal is to use PokemonGo’s concept in a new way; Pokemon Stops will now be called MoonBeams where players can go to refresh their energy and attack power at random (subject to change). Pokemon Gyms will now be monster lairs/dungeons for the player to progress through. As the player gains experience and levels, they will gain stronger powers and be able to upgrade their sailor scout (ex, Sailor Moon, Super Sailor Moon, etc). Much of this is subject to change as the game is fleshed out.
